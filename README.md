SoTi is a group project website mockup created to review on-line independent web series. Users submit their favorite Web Series with brief description and links to the trailer and the series homepage. Users can also review other series that they are familiar with or that they have been lead to by the site. If a review is helpful or not helpful it can be voted up or down. A user can change their vote on a review as well as delete their vote, but cannot vote more than once.

Our group used this project to test a number of web based technologies listed in no particular order.
- Ruby on Rails
- HTML
- CSS
- Foundations
